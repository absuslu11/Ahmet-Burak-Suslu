            <p><b>In this project, I wanted to learn the basics of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) in Microsoft Azure.</b></p>
            <p><b>I will list the basics of what was done in this project to give you all an understanding of what actually went through
              this project my struggles and things that I found interesting.</b></p>
            <p>1. At first I had to build up a virtual machine (VM) that would be vulnerable to any outside threats so I could see the
              attacks that is being made to the VM. for this to happen I want to the outside firewall of the VM and turned it off I
              also went and turned off the Microsoft firewall which made it very vulnerable to any outside threat. I also used a
              PowerShell to extract the IP addresses of the attacks and with the help of a 3rd party API, I was able to get the
              Latitude and longitude of the attacks.</p>
            <p>2. next up I created a log repository in Azure which was done using the Azures Log Analytics Workspace. The log
              analytics pretty much got the data that is being transmitted through the VM so we could have data that stores all the
              attacks. this part was a little bit tricky to make since I had to handle a lot of variables and it could get a little
              bit complicated but in the end, I was able to get it sorted.</p>
            <p>3. Lastly I used Azure Sentinel which is Microsofts cloud SIEM. the Sentinel's biggest job is to use the logs that are
              stored in the log analytics to create a map of the attacks that are done to the vulnerable VM.</p>
            <p>In the end, this is what It looked like unfortunately, I didn't keep the VM running long enough to have more attacks
              coming in which is why my map looks mostly empty or people are too scared to attack me.</p>

            <p> <b>
              In this project, I wanted to learn how to web 
              scrape using <b>BeutifullSoup</b> and import the data to Excel.
            </b></p>
            <p><b>
              This project was designed to get top 250 movies of all time and list their Rank, Name, Year, and Rating.
               I will also list my struggles and things that I found interesting in this project.
            </b></p>
            <p>
              1. At first I had to <b>import requests and BeutifullSoup</b>, requests help me make requests to the chosen website which in our case is (IMDB.com) 
              and BeutifullSoup helps us retrive the needed HTML 
              contents of the website by using filters.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. next up I coded a try and except statements to first figure out wether the website link is giving code 200 or 404.
              if the code was good BeutifullSoup would get the HTML contents of the website which by using 
              <b>"Soup.find()"</b> we can find the needed sections, Divs, and other needed tags.

            </p>
            <p>3. one of the things I struggled the most was that IMDB website did not let me have a session using Requests.
               At first I couldnt figure out what was wrong after doing a reaserch for some time we can use headers to show as we are a human which after
               I did it let me get the parsed HTML. 

            </p>
            <p>
              After getting the needed Rank, Name, Year, and Rating I imported <b>openpyxl</b> whcih let me create an excel sheet and import each data into an excel file.
              Later on i also added a filter whch let you chose a movie by the year.
            </p>
